    question: "How can I see what a tattoo will look like on me?",
    answer: "With TattThat, simply upload a photo of your body, choose a tattoo design from our library or convert your own image, position it where you want, and our AI will render a photorealistic preview in seconds. It's the easiest way to visualize your tattoo before committing to real ink."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an app to preview tattoos on your body?",
    answer: "Yes! TattThat is a free iOS app that lets you preview any tattoo on your actual body. Unlike generic tattoo apps that use stock photos, TattThat uses your real photo and AI to show exactly how a tattoo would look on YOUR skin, with your lighting and body shape."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I design my own tattoo from a photo?",
    answer: "Absolutely. TattThat's custom conversion feature lets you turn any image into a clean tattoo design. Upload a photo of your pet, a sketch, a logo, or any image—our AI will convert it into ink-ready artwork that you can then preview on your body."
  },
  {
    question: "How realistic are the tattoo previews?",
    answer: "Our AI generates photorealistic results that follow your skin's contours, lighting, and texture. Many users share their previews and friends ask 'Is that real?' That's the level of realism we're talking about. The previews are realistic enough to help you make confident decisions about your tattoo."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a good placement for a first tattoo?",
    answer: "Popular first tattoo placements include the inner forearm, wrist, ankle, and shoulder. These areas are relatively easy to hide if needed and typically less painful. With TattThat, you can try different placements on YOUR body to see what looks best before deciding."
  },
  {
    question: "Is TattThat free to use?",
    answer: "TattThat offers 2 free credits when you download—enough to try the app and see the quality for yourself. Additional credits can be purchased as needed, with no subscription required. Pay only for what you use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my photos?",
    answer: "Your privacy matters. Photos are processed to generate your tattoo preview and are not stored on our servers. We don't keep, share, or use your images for any other purpose."
