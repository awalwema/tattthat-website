    question: "How can I see what a tattoo will look like on me?",
    answer: "With TattThat, simply upload a photo of your body, choose a tattoo design from our library or convert your own image, position it where you want, and see a photorealistic preview in seconds. It's the easiest way to visualize your tattoo before committing to real ink."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I design my own tattoo from a photo?",
    answer: "Absolutely. TattThat's custom conversion feature lets you turn any image into a clean tattoo design. Upload a photo of your pet, a sketch, a logo, or any image—we'll convert it into ink-ready artwork that you can then preview on your body."
  },
  {
    question: "How realistic are the tattoo previews?",
    answer: "The results follow your skin's contours, lighting, and texture. Many users share their previews and friends ask 'Is that real?' That's the level of realism we're talking about. Realistic enough to help you make confident decisions about your tattoo."
  },
  {
    question: "Is TattThat free to use?",
    answer: "TattThat offers 2 free tattoo previews when you download—enough to try the app and see the quality for yourself. Additional credits can be purchased as needed, with no subscription required. Pay only for what you use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my photos?",
    answer: "Your privacy matters. Photos are processed to generate your tattoo preview and are not stored on our servers. We don't keep, share, or use your images for any other purpose."
