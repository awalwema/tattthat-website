        <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          TattThat provides AI-generated tattoo previews for visualization purposes only. The previews are artistic renderings and may not perfectly represent how a real tattoo would appear. Always consult with a professional tattoo artist before getting actual ink.
